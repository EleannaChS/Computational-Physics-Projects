Programs written as part of the course Computational Mathematics I. Below is a brief description of the programs written in Python 3.9.
1. set1_ex1: Root of equation using the bisection and the Newton-Rapson method
2. set1_ex2: Root of equation using the x=g(x) method
3. set1_ex3: Lagrange polynomials
4. set1_ex4: Newton 's divided differences formula to calculate an interpolating polynomial going through given points
5. set3_ex1: The simple Simpson's h/3 rule and the same rule with n=8 to calculate given integral
6. set3_ex2: Euler's method and Runge Kutta 4th order
