Programs written as part of the course Computational Mathematics II. Below is a brief description of the programs written in Python 3.9.
1. The Romeo and Juliet date problem (Romeo_Juliet.py).
   Each one delays from 0 to 1hr
   When each arrives, waits 15min and then leaves
   What is the probability they meet
2. The Monty Hall problem (Monty_Hall.py).
3. 2D integration using MCMV method (2DInt_MCMV.py)
4. Multi-D integration using MCMV method (MultiDInt_MCMV.py)
5. Acceptance - Rejection method (AccRe.py)
   *requested f(x)=2/(pi(1-x^2)^0.5), 0<x<1
    we choose g(x)=1/(2(1-x)^0.5)  
    k: f(x)/g(x) supremum
    f(x)/g(x)= 4/(pi*(1+x)^0.5) <= 4/pi, hence k = 4/pi
6. The 1D Ising model (Ising.py)
